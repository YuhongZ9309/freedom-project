            <h1>How to become a hacker?</h1>
            <p>Anyone can become a hacker. Programming is all about building and making things like websites, games, and etc. Hacking or to be a hacker you have to think differently from a programmer, instead of building and making, thinking about how to break down the information that you are given. It all about perspective hacking is another perspective of programming where instead of building, you break stuff.</p>
